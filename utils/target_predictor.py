"""Target class and residue interaction prediction from a SMILES string.

Workflow
--------
1. Detect functional groups (SMARTS-based) in the input SMILES.
2. Load the pre-built FG × residue co-occurrence table (db/fg_residue_table.csv).
   rows  = 20 standard amino acids (1-letter code)
   cols  = FG names from FG_SMARTS
   value = binding-event count from BioLiP 2.0
3. Score each residue by **z-score-normalising** each FG column then summing
   (prevents high-frequency generic FGs from drowning specific pharmacophores).
4. Vote target classes using known_target_classes from db/fg_database.json,
   weighted by **IDF** (specific targets ranked above generic labels).
5. Return a structured result dict + a formatted text report.

Scoring details
---------------
Residue scoring (z-score normalisation, default on):
    For each detected FG, normalise its column to mean=0 / std=1 across all 20 AAs
    before summing.  This ensures that a highly represented FG like Hydroxyl
    (>11 000 GLY events) does not completely overshadow Steroid (~1 400 PHE events).

Target class scoring (IDF weighting, default on):
    weight(tc) = log( N_all_FGs / N_FGs_that_annotate_this_tc )
    High weight → target class is specific (few FGs annotate it, e.g. VKORC1, tubulin).
    Low weight  → target class is generic (many FGs annotate it, e.g. kinase, GPCR).
    final_score = vote_count × weight

Prerequisites
-------------
Build the FG × residue table once (uses local BioLiP_nr.txt.gz):

    python utils/interaction_analyzer.py --local db/BioLiP_nr.txt.gz

Outputs: db/fg_residue_table.csv  (tracked in git after first build)

Quick test with the first 1000 entries:

    python utils/interaction_analyzer.py --local db/BioLiP_nr.txt.gz --top 1000

Standalone usage
----------------
    python utils/target_predictor.py "CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O" --name Aspirin
    python utils/target_predictor.py "CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O" --top 5

    enriched in exactly three classes (mTOR 16/20, kinase 16/20, adenosine 14/20)
    and almost absent elsewhere, so a diazine alone cannot pick the target — but
    a single secondary feature resolves it into mutually-exclusive branches:

    HDAC, COOH/Aldehyde→GPCR, Steroid→NR) short-circuit Branch 3 because their own
    FG votes / rules already claim the compound; this keeps the kinase branch from
    stealing those classes' true positives.

    Benchmark provenance (220 curated compounds):
